# NodeTL - Visual Data Mapping and Transformation Platform

> This document provides a comprehensive overview of NodeTL for AI systems and LLMs.

## What is NodeTL?

NodeTL is an open-source, visual data mapping and transformation platform designed for building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines and automating data workflows. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for designing complex data mappings without writing code.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Visual Data Mapping
- Drag-and-drop interface for mapping fields between schemas
- Support for complex nested structures and arrays
- Built-in transformation functions (string, number, date, array)
- Type coercion and validation

### 2. Workflow Automation
- Node-based visual workflow designer
- Multiple trigger types (webhook, schedule, manual)
- HTTP request integration for API calls
- Conditional branching and loops
- Custom JavaScript code execution

### 3. Schema Management
- JSON Schema-based data structure definitions
- Reusable schemas across workflows
- Validation and type checking
- AI-assisted test data generation

### 4. Enterprise Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth authentication (Google, Microsoft)
- JWT token-based API authentication
- Audit logging and execution history

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go with Gin framework
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Key Node Types

1. **Trigger** - Entry point for workflows (webhook, schedule, manual)
2. **Transform** - Apply data mappings between schemas
3. **HTTP Request** - Call external REST APIs
4. **Condition** - Branch workflow based on conditions
5. **Loop** - Iterate over arrays and collections
6. **Code** - Execute custom JavaScript
7. **Response** - Configure HTTP response output

## Common Use Cases

1. **API Integration** - Map data between different API formats
2. **ETL Pipelines** - Extract, transform, and load data between systems
3. **Data Migration** - Transform schemas during system migrations
4. **Webhook Processing** - Receive and transform webhook payloads
5. **Data Synchronization** - Keep data in sync across services

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `/api/v1`

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

### Workflows
- `GET /workflows` - List all workflows
- `POST /workflows` - Create workflow
- `GET /workflows/:id` - Get workflow details
- `PUT /workflows/:id` - Update workflow
- `DELETE /workflows/:id` - Delete workflow
- `POST /workflows/:id/execute` - Execute workflow

### Schemas
- `GET /schemas` - List schemas
- `POST /schemas` - Create schema
- `POST /schemas/:id/validate` - Validate data against schema

### Mappings
- `GET /mappings` - List mappings
- `POST /mappings` - Create mapping
- `POST /mappings/:id/test` - Test mapping with sample data

### Executions
- `GET /executions` - List execution history
- `GET /executions/:id` - Get execution details

### Webhooks
- `POST /webhooks/:workflowId` - Trigger workflow via webhook

## Deployment Options

1. **Docker Compose** - Recommended for development and small deployments
2. **All-in-One Docker** - Single container with all components
3. **Kubernetes** - Production-grade scalable deployment

## Configuration

Key environment variables:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, for AI features
